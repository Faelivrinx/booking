Architecture Decision Record: Booking System Design
Title
Booking System Architecture Design using Domain-Driven Design and CQRS Pattern
Status
Accepted
Context
We're building a booking system that needs to handle complex business rules around scheduling, staff availability, and appointment management. The system has several key requirements:

Core Booking Functionality:

Management of services, including their durations and staff associations
Flexible staff availability management
Prevention of double bookings


Business Rules & Constraints:

Staff-service association validation
Support for "appointment-only" time blocks
Tracking of no-shows


Security & Role-Based Access:

Different permission levels for business owners, staff, and clients


Client Experience:

Fast and responsive display of available booking slots
Intuitive booking process



The architecture must be maintainable, scalable, and support efficient queries for finding available slots, which is a critical operation for the user experience.
Decision
We've decided to implement the system using:

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for the core business logic
Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to separate read and write operations
Event-Driven Architecture to synchronize the read and write models
Repository Pattern to abstract data access

Key Architectural Components:
1. Domain Model

Aggregates: Appointment, StaffDailyAvailability, StaffServiceAllocation
Value Objects: TimeSlot
Domain Events: AppointmentCreatedEvent, StaffDailyAvailabilityUpdatedEvent, etc.
Domain Services: BookingDomainService, AvailabilityDomainService, etc.

2. Read Model

Optimized database tables for fast queries:

AvailableBookingSlot: Pre-calculated available time slots
StaffDailySchedule: Staff schedule including both available and booked time slots
ClientAppointmentView: Denormalized view of appointments for clients


Read Models are synchronized with the Domain Model via Domain Events

3. Application Services

Commands: Handle write operations through domain services
Queries: Directly access read models for efficient read operations

4. API Layer

RESTful endpoints for client and staff interactions

Consequences
Positive

Strong Domain Model: Business rules are captured in a rich domain model that accurately reflects the problem space.
Performance Optimization: The read model is optimized for the most common queries, particularly finding available booking slots.
Atomic Operations: The system ensures that availability is updated atomically when appointments are booked, preventing double bookings.
Scalability: The separation of read and write operations allows for independent scaling.
Flexibility: Domain events allow for loose coupling between components.

Negative

Complexity: The CQRS pattern adds complexity to the system.
Eventual Consistency: The read model may be temporarily out of sync with the domain model.
Development Overhead: Maintaining separate read and write models requires additional development effort.

Neutral

Event Sourcing Potential: The current design could be extended to use full Event Sourcing in the future if required.
Technology Stack Dependencies: The design works well with Spring Boot and JPA but doesn't depend on specific technologies.

Special Considerations
Booking Process
The booking process is implemented to ensure atomicity:

When a client books an appointment, we validate availability in the domain model
If valid, we create the appointment AND atomically update the staff availability by splitting the time slot
We then update the read models via domain events

Availability Management
Staff availability is managed with precision:

Staff members set their availability for specific days
When appointments are booked, availability is automatically adjusted (split)
Changes to availability are validated to ensure existing appointments aren't affected

Performance Optimization
To ensure fast client-facing queries:

We pre-calculate available booking slots based on staff availability and services
We generate these slots at 15-minute intervals for each service a staff member can perform
We maintain these in a denormalized read model optimized for queries

Implementation Notes
Key Components

Domain Model: The core business logic, implemented as rich domain objects
Read Model: Optimized for queries, particularly finding available slots
Domain Services: Encapsulate complex business operations
Application Services: Handle use cases and coordinate domain operations
Read Model Synchronization: Event-based updating of the read model

Database Strategy
We use a single relational database with:

Tables for domain entities (appointments, availability, etc.)
Denormalized tables for read models (available slots, schedules, etc.)
Optimized indexes for common queries

Alternatives Considered

Traditional N-tier Architecture

Rejected because it doesn't handle complex domain logic as cleanly
Would lead to lower query performance for finding available slots


Weekly Schedule Templates

Initially considered having weekly templates that staff would use
Simplified to direct availability management for more flexibility


Single Model (No CQRS)

Would be simpler but wouldn't support the performance needs
Finding available slots would require complex calculations for each request



Open Questions

How to handle timezone differences efficiently?
Should we implement full Event Sourcing in the future?
How to optimize the read model synchronization for high load?
